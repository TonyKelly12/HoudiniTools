# Redshift Material Tool v2

An advanced Houdini tool for automatically creating Redshift materials from texture directories with support for UDIM textures and customizable texture paths.

## Features

- **Custom Texture Directory Selection**: Choose any directory to scan for textures
- **Interactive Material Creation**: Preview available materials before creating them
- **UDIM Texture Support**: Comprehensive support for various UDIM naming conventions
- **Material Organization Options**: Create separate folders for materials
- **Batch Processing**: Create multiple materials at once
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during material creation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Option to overwrite existing materials

## Improvements from Version 1

- Added a user interface with file browser for selecting texture directories
- Interactive material list showing detected texture sets before creation
- Material selection capability for creating specific materials
- Option to create folder organization in the material context
- Progress dialog with real-time feedback
- Improved error handling and user notifications

## Installation

See the included [Installation Guide](path/to/installation_guide.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Texture Organization

For the tool to correctly identify textures, organize them following these guidelines:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   [texture_directory]/
     ├── [mesh_name1]/
     │   ├── [material1]_basecolor.exr
     │   ├── [material1]_normal.exr
     │   ├── [material2]_1001_basecolor.exr
     │   └── [material2]_1002_basecolor.exr
     └── [mesh_name2]/
         ├── [material3]_basecolor.exr
         └── [material3]_roughness.exr
   ```

2. **UDIM Naming Conventions**:
   - Standard UDIM: `texture_1001_diffuse.exr`, `texture_1002_diffuse.exr`
   - Mari-style: `texture_u1_v1_diffuse.exr`, `texture_u2_v1_diffuse.exr`
   - Various separators: Both dot and underscore (e.g., `texture.1001.diffuse.exr` or `texture_1001_diffuse.exr`)

## Usage Workflow

1. Launch the Redshift Material Tool v2 from the shelf
2. Select the texture directory using the file browser
3. Click "Scan for Textures" to detect material sets
4. Review the list of materials to be created
5. Set options as needed:
   - Check "Overwrite existing materials" to replace materials that already exist
   - Check "Create separate folder for each material" to organize materials in subfolders
6. Select specific materials from the list (or leave all unselected to process everything)
7. Click "Create Materials" to generate the Redshift materials

## Supported Texture Types

The tool automatically identifies and connects the following texture types:

- **Base Color**: basecolor, diffuse, albedo, col, color, diff
- **Roughness**: roughness, rough, rgh
- **Metallic**: metallic, metal, mtl
- **Normal Maps**: normal, nrm, norm
- **Bump Maps**: bump, bmp
- **Displacement**: displacement, disp, displace, height
- **Emission**: emission, emissive, emit
- **Ambient Occlusion**: ao, ambient, occlusion

## Automatic Color Space Setup

The tool automatically sets the appropriate color space for each texture type:
- sRGB for basecolor and emission textures
- Raw for all other texture types (normal, roughness, metallic, etc.)

## Requirements

- Houdini with Redshift installed
- PySide2 (included with Houdini)
- Python 3.x (included with Houdini)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Houdini console for error messages
2. Verify your texture directory organization
3. Confirm that Redshift is properly installed
4. Check naming conventions of your texture files
