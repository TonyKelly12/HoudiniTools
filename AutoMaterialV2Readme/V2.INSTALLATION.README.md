# Redshift Material Tool v2 - Installation Guide

This guide will help you install and use the updated Redshift Material Tool v2, which includes a file browser for selecting texture directories.

## Installation

1. **Create the Required Files:**
   - Save the main tool script as: `redshift_material_tool_v2.py`
   - Location: 
     - Windows: `C:/Users/[username]/Documents/houdini[version]/scripts/python/`
     - Mac: `~/Library/Preferences/houdini/[version]/scripts/python/`
     - Linux: `~/houdini[version]/scripts/python/`

2. **Add the Tool to Your Shelf:**
   There are two ways to add the tool to your shelf:

   **Method 1: Using the script's built-in function**
   - Open Houdini
   - Open the Python Shell (Windows > Python Shell)
   - Run the following code:
   ```python
   import redshift_material_tool_v2
   redshift_material_tool_v2.add_tool_to_shelf()
   ```

   **Method 2: Manually add to shelf**
   - Right-click on the Redshift shelf (or any shelf you prefer)
   - Select "New Tool..."
   - Enter "RS Materials v2" as the Label
   - Select an appropriate icon (like SHELF_redshift)
   - In the "Script" tab, add the following code:
   ```python
   import redshift_material_tool_v2
   redshift_material_tool_v2.create_redshift_material_tool_v2()
   ```
   - Click Accept

## Usage

1. **Launch the Tool:**
   - Click the "RS Materials v2" button in your shelf

2. **Select Texture Directory:**
   - The default path is `$HIP/tex`
   - Click "Browse..." to select a different directory

3. **Scan for Textures:**
   - Click "Scan for Textures" to detect materials in the selected directory
   - The tool will list all found materials with their texture types

4. **Set Options:**
   - "Overwrite existing materials" - Check this to replace materials that already exist
   - "Create separate folder for each material" - Check this to organize materials in subfolders

5. **Create Materials:**
   - Select specific materials from the list, or leave all unselected to process everything
   - Click "Create Materials" to generate the Redshift materials

## Additional Information

- The tool still maintains all UDIM texture handling capabilities from Version 1
- Materials are listed by mesh name and material name, following the folder structure of your textures
- The progress dialog shows real-time feedback during material creation
- You can cancel the operation at any time

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Console Output:**
   - Open the Houdini console (Windows > Shell)
   - Look for error messages that might indicate what went wrong

2. **Verify Texture Directory:**
   - Make sure the selected directory contains properly organized textures
   - The expected structure is: `[texture_dir]/[mesh_name]/[textures]`

3. **Check Redshift Installation:**
   - The tool requires a working Redshift installation
   - If Redshift nodes aren't available, the tool will display an error message
